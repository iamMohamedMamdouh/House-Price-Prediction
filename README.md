# Housing Price Prediction

A simple project to prepare data and build a predictive model for housing prices.

# Content
- `housing.csv` — Data file
- `california_housing_notebook.ipynb` — Colab notebook (EDA, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation)
- (Optional) `rf_pipeline.joblib` — The saved model after training

# Quickstart
1. Open `notebook.ipynb` in Repo.
2. Run the cells in order (the data is already in the repo, so you don't need to upload it manually).
3. Results and explanations are provided in Markdown fields within the notebook.

# Quicknotes
- The notebook contains a comparison between Linear Regression and Random Forest.
- If you need to save or reuse the model, see the `rf_pipeline.joblib` file (if it exists).
